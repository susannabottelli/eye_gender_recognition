# eye_gender_recognition
AI Bootcamp Challenge: build a model to classify eye pictures to genders.


## Problem Statement
The anthropometric analysis of the human face is an essential study for performing craniofacial plastic and reconstructive surgeries. Facial anthropometrics are affected by various factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, environment, and region.  
 
Plastic surgeons who undertake the repair and reconstruction of facial deformities find the anatomical dimensions of the facial structures useful for their surgeries. These dimensions are a result of the Physical or Facial appearance of an individual. Along with factors like culture, personality, ethnic background, age; eye appearance and symmetry contributes majorly to the facial appearance or aesthetics. 
 
Our objective is to build a model to scan the image of an eye of a patient and find if the gender of the patient is male or female.
The dataset contains eye pictures of males and females. The dataset can be downloaded from the below link.

From the above link, you will be able to download a zip file named ‘eye_gender_data.zip’. After you extract this zip file, you will get four files:
train - contains all the images that are to be used for training your model.
Training_set.csv - this csv file has contains the labels for the training images
test - contains 9000+ images. For these images you are required to make predictions
Testing_set.csv - this is the order of the predictions for each image that is to be submitted on the platform. Make sure the predictions you submit are with their image’s filename in the same order as given in this file.
sample_submission.csv- this is the sample submission file for the data sprint
